# Epistagraph

Epistagraph is a design tool for knowlege based progression systems, or "knowlege checks" as they are more commonly known.
It allows the designer to be specific about where a player is expected to learn about a certain mechanic, and better plan to avoid frustrating scenarios in non-linear games.
It can also be used to create elaborate and interconnected secrets and puzzles, especially ARGs.

To use the tool just download the latest .exe and .pck file and run the program.

All actions may be done with the right click menu or through keyboard shortcuts.

Make sure to save progress (stored in a .res file of the name provided) as the program does not yet have autosave functionality.
